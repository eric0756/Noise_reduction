# Organisation

The MATLAB folder contains the MATLAB simulation.
The C folder contains the the C and assembly codes.
The PDF file at the root of the project is the article on which the project is based on.


# Comments

The project has been realised using Code Composer Studio v5 from Texas Instruments (for the C and assembly codes).
However, a Makefile is given to compile the *C codes* independently.
